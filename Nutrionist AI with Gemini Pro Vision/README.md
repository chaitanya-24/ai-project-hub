# Nutritionist AI with Gemini Pro Vision üç¥

## Project Overview
Nutritionist AI is an intelligent web application that transforms the way people understand their food choices. By simply uploading a photo of their meal, users receive instant, detailed nutritional analysis powered by Google's advanced Gemini Pro Vision AI technology.

## What Makes This Project Special
The application bridges the gap between visual food recognition and nutritional analysis by:
- Instantly identifying multiple food items in a single image
- Providing accurate calorie counts for each identified item
- Breaking down the nutritional composition of the entire meal
- Offering personalized health insights about the meal's overall nutritional value

## Core Functionality

### 1. Image Analysis
The application processes uploaded food images through these steps:
- Accepts common image formats (PNG, JPEG, JPG)
- Converts the image into a format suitable for AI analysis
- Sends the processed image to Gemini Pro Vision for interpretation

### 2. Nutritional Analysis
For each analyzed image, the system provides:
- A detailed list of identified food items with individual calorie counts
- Comprehensive nutrient breakdown including:
  - Carbohydrates percentage
  - Fat content
  - Fiber content
  - Sugar levels
  - Other essential nutrients

### 3. Health Assessment
The AI provides:
- An evaluation of the meal's overall healthiness
- Balanced nutritional insights
- Percentage-based breakdown of macro and micronutrients

### 4. User Interface
Built with Streamlit, the interface offers:
- A clean, intuitive design
- Simple drag-and-drop image upload
- Clear presentation of analysis results
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
